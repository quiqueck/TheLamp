/*
    Animation: calculates colors based on time (in seconds)
        - does not composit
        - writes to one of the available layers
        - can have alpha
        - must be able to play endless 
            - use TimeConverter to repeat or flipflop automatically
            - Default TimeConverter is identity
            - If animation has time limit (duration>0), repeat and flipFlop are available
    Timeline: contains a set of animation and composit tracks based on an animation time
        - Tracks contain Animations that start at given times and play for a given duration
        - Animation Tracks write to defined Layers in given order (Background, Bottom, Middle, Top)
            - Composit Tracks can create the FinalComposit Layer from the animation data in lower layers
            - Default Composit is copy
            - Composit can be used to build Transitions
            - Composit = specialization of Animation class?
    Action: Part of the TimeLine, can influence the animation time and speed
        - stop (will halt the animation)
        - speed (will change the time scale)
        - wait (will wait for an event)
